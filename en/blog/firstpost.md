so i feel like, writing this journal is alot like blogging  
ive been kinda wanting to blog for awhile now  
i used to have this internal thing which i just used to talk thru issues

i had this spare TLD sitting around, i have to set up something similar for the homelab pretty soon, so why not  
im pretty sure imma just set up a 11ty blog and publish some markdown to it

im going to get to that now, lets see how long that takes, im guessing 15-20 minutes?  
lets see how far off we are

30:28 until i got the site published,  
DNS is giving me problems, but that always happens, just takes awhile to re-provision
