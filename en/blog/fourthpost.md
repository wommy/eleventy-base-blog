last time i was working on some type of inventory,  
and i was just thinking that that is what is most needed in my life

this past week, i got a bunch of harddrives, and an enclosure,  
i ended up buying a bunch of esata cables,  
plus a few trips to microcentre,  
my house feels so disorganized

---

like i completely wiped my OS and started from scratch today  
the chromebook is running better than ever
