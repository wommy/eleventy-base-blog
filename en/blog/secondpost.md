first of all i want to mention that,  
im watching [dieselcreek](//www.youtube.com/dieselcreek) rebuild a 1980 autocar semi truck

so i recently went to the library, i got two books, 
- a home networking one,
- and a golang one

the golang one i believe is 10 chapters, each with a workbook type portion.
